                        I grew up in the suburbs and have been living in the Greater Toronto Area for my whole life. Received my Ontario Secondary School Diploma after graduating in 2015 and then I moved on to study Computer Engineering at Ryerson University.

                        My last job was working at Healthy Pets where I used the Ionic framework to update the companyâ€™s cross-platform hybrid mobile app using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a new UX/UI and backend based on mockups. I also worked on some smaller projects  using PHP and Python.
