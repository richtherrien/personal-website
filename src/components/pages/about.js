                    <p>
                        Intially I worked in IT, gaining experience about
                        managing information for a medium size company. I
                        provided administrative support, maintained inventory,
                        updated the filing and other tracking systems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Later, I moved on to work at Startuptive where I worked
                        on creating a demo product to showcase to investors. I
                        developed in C++ and Java using Android Studios and
                        investigated the hardware and software architecture of
                        Internet of Things based devices,
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then as a Software Engineer at Healthy Pets where I used
                        the Ionic framework to update the companyâ€™s
                        cross-platform hybrid mobile app using JavaScript, HTML,
                        and CSS to create a new UX/UI and backend based on
                        mockups. I also worked on some smaller projects using
                        PHP and Python.

                    <p>
                        At Social Enterprise for Canada I worked with Vue.js and
                        PHP to develop web applications to reduce administrative
                        burdens as well as implementing data analytics and
                        reporting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, I am working full-time as a Full Stack
                        Developer for Nextech AR Solutions.
